# Documentation â€“ Local Bike Intermediate Layer

## Overview

The models in the **models/intermediate/Local_Bike** layer represent the **analytical view** of the Local Bike business.  
They transform the cleaned data from the `staging` models into **dimension** and **fact** tables, ready to be used in the **models/mart/Local_Bike** layer.

The goal of this layer is to provide a **reliable, documented, and actionable** data foundation for analyzing the dimensions and facts tables.
